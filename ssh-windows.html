<h1>SSH on Windows</h1>
<hr>
<p>GitForce uses PuTTY daemon and PLINK proxy to manage SSH keys for git 
commands. This tutorial assumes you are setting up a github project, but the 
same principle should apply with other SSH servers.</p>
<p>Click on the &quot;Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Manage SSH Keys...&quot; to open up a SSH dialog (you 
can also click on the icon of keys on the main app toolbar).</p>

<p>If you don't have your own key, you need to create it.</p>
<p>Click on the PuTTYgen (marked as &quot;3&quot;) to start a PuTTY generation utility. 
Click on the &quot;Generate&quot; and move your mouse as the key is being generated, after 
which you should see your public key ready:</p>

<p>Click on &quot;Save private key&quot; and save the complete key pair onto your local 
drive (its extension should be *.PPK). We will need that file in a later step.</p>
<p>Select all text from the public key control (starting with &quot;ssh-rsa...&quot;) and 
copy it... into the github: &quot;Account Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;SSH Public Keys&quot; as 
illustrated here:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="Resources/ssh-github.gif" width="757" height="472"></p>
<p>Go back to the SSH dialog and see &quot;Select keys to import&quot; listbox (marked 
above as &quot;1&quot;). Keys listed there will be auto-loaded next time you start 
GitForce. We want to add our key to this list. That's the key we saved in a step 
above.</p>
<p>Click on the &quot;Add...&quot; next to the &quot;Select keys to import&quot; and navigate to the 
key you saved (its extension should be *.PPK).</p>
<p>Click on &quot;Import now&quot; to actually import this key into the Pageant. If you 
open Pageant (by double-clicking on the icon of a computer with a hat in your OS 
status bar), you should see a key being added.</p>

<p>The last thing we need to do is to add github's public key to our list of 
known hosts. Open the SSH dialog again and select the &quot;Remote Keys&quot; tab (as 
opposed to &quot;Local Keys&quot; tab which we used this far). Paste your project's SSH 
address and click on the &quot;Add Host&quot;.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="Resources/ssh-add-github-key.gif" width="481" height="428"></p>
<p>You should see github's SSH information added to the list of known hosts:</p>
<p>

<p>You are ready to push/pull to your project now using the SSH protocol.</p>
