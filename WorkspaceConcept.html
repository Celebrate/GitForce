<h1>Workspace</h1>
<hr>
<p>Under the main application File menu there are operations for managing 
workspaces:</p>

<p>A workspace is simply a set of repositories. Each workspace can store a 
number of repos. GitForce is using its own default workspace to store all repos 
listed under Repositories pane.</p>
<p>Having the option to group sets of repos comes useful when you have related 
sets which you may want to keep separate, for example when working with <b>
Android</b> source trees: you can keep repos from each Android branch separately 
(if your workflow sets it up that way).</p>
