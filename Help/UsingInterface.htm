<h2>Using the git4win Interface</h2>
<h3><b>View Menu</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Git View of Local Files</b> - Show the files in the 
working directory as git would see them, including the untracked files (files 
that were not already added to the repository.) If the files are identical to 
the repository (not changed), nothing will be shown. The files shown are 
basically result of running a <i>git status</i> command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Git View of Files</b> - Show the files in the working 
directory as git would see them, but do not show untracked files (files that 
were not already added to the repository.) Not showing untracked files is the 
only difference that this view mode has compared to a previous view, Git View of 
Local Files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Git View of Repo</b> - Show the git view of files in 
its repository database. The files listed in this view may have nothing to do 
with the actual files in the working directory as this is the view of the 
database only. For that reason, many operations usually allowed in other view 
modes are not present in this mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Local File View</b> - Show the files in the working 
directory as Windows' Explorer would see them. This is a true directory file 
listing and all files are shown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Local Files Not in Repo</b> - Only show untracked files 
in the working directory.</p>
